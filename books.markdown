## Books

As this is a blog partly dedicated to books, I have set this page up to track
the books I read. Books listed here are fiction, and non-academic non-fiction;
academic books are not tracked.

Books I especially liked are marked with an asterisk  `*`.

### Books I am currently reading
* _India After Gandhi_ by Ramchandra Guha
* _The Haunting of Hill House_ by Shirley Jackson
* I am also working my way through the works of H. P. Lovecraft

### Books I have read this year
1. _There There_ by Tommy Orange
2. _Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus_ by Mary Shelley
3. _The Godfather_ by Mario Puzo `*`
