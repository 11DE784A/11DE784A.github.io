## Books

As a blog that is partly dedicated to books, it is no surprise that I have set
up a page to track the books I read. Books listed here are fiction, and
non-academic non-fiction; academic books are not tracked.

Books I especially liked are marked with an asterisk  `*`.

### Books I am currently reading
* _India After Gandhi_ by Ramchandra Guha
* _The Haunting of Hill House_ by Shirley Jackson
* I am also working my way through the works of H. P. Lovecraft

### Books I have read this year
1. _There There_ by Tommy Orange
2. _Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus_ by Mary Shelley
