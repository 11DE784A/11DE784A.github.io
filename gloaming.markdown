# The Gloaming

This page contains information about the Dungeons and Dragons 2024 campaign I
am running in _The Gloaming_ mini-setting from _Shadowdark "Cursed Scroll"
Zine Volume&nbsp;1_. The campaign is set in an ancient cursed forest home to cultists,
demons, orcs, trolls, werewolves, witches, an order of cursed knights, a lost
wizard, and malevolent eldritch entities. 

## Adventuring Party

__Level__: 3

__Corvin Thorne.__ Human Warlock (Fiend Patron) of [redacted].

__Edran Vale.__ Human Warlock (Great Old One Patron) of Mugdulblub.

__Elowen Truthbearer.__ Human Paladin (Oath of Devotion) of St. Terragnis.

__Jake.__ Human Monk (Warrior of Shadow) who serves Madeera.

__Kayle.__ Aasimar Bard / Paladin of St. Terragnis.

## Gods of the Gloaming

Most folk worship one of The Four Lords, the lawful and neutral gods who stand
for justice, order, and mercy. 

- __Saint Terragnis.__
A legendary knight who is the patron of most lawful humans.  She ascended to
godhood long ago and is the embodiment of righteousness and justice.

- __Madeera the Covenant.__
Madeera was the first manifestation of Law. She carries every law of reality, a
dictate called the Covenant, written on her skin in precise symbols. 

- __Gede.__
The god of feasts, mirth, and the wilds. Gede is usually peaceful, but primal
storms rage when her anger rises. Many elves and halflings worship her.

- __Ord.__
Ord the Unbending, the Wise, the Secret-Keeper. He is the god of magic,
knowledge, secrets, and equilibrium.

Others worship one of the so-called Dark Trio, chaotic deities
who evince freedom, anarchy, and disorder.

- __Memnon.__
Memnon was the first manifestation of Chaos. He is Madeera’s twin, a red-maned,
leonine being whose ultimate ambition is to rend the cosmic laws of the
Covenant from his sister’s skin. 

- __Ramlaat.__
Ramlaat is the Pillager, the Barbaric, the Horde. Many orcs worship him and
live by the Blood Rite, a prophecy that says only the strongest will survive a
coming doom.

- __Shune the Vile.__
Shune whispers arcane secrets to sorcerers and witches who call to her in the
dark hours. She schemes to free the vast flow of magic by displacing Ord.

Two of The Nine are lost to the ages, their names expunged from history and
memory. Yet their whispered legend lives on in ancient texts and forgotten
places...

Mugdulblub and The Willowman are two of the many eldritch beings of immense
power who grant boons in exchange of their petitioners' service.

- __Mugdulblub.__
The Elder Ooze that leaks between the cracks in memory and the darkness between
the stars. Mugdulblub seeks the dissolution of all physical form.

- __The Willowman.__
A ghostly, elongated being who stalks misty forests and watches from the edge
of nightmares. The Willowman seeks fear.
