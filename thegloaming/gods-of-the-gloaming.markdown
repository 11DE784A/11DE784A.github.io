# Gods of the Gloaming

## The Four Lords

Most folk worship one of The Four Lords, the lawful and neutral gods who stand
for justice, order, and mercy. 

- __Saint Terragnis.__
A legendary knight who is the patron of most lawful humans.  She ascended to
godhood long ago and is the embodiment of righteousness and justice.

- __Madeera the Covenant.__
Madeera was the first manifestation of Law. She carries every law of reality, a
dictate called the Covenant, written on her skin in precise symbols. 

- __Gede.__
The god of feasts, mirth, and the wilds. Gede is usually peaceful, but primal
storms rage when her anger rises. Many elves and halflings worship her.

- __Ord.__
Ord the Unbending, the Wise, the Secret-Keeper. He is the god of magic,
knowledge, secrets, and equilibrium.

## The Dark Trio

Others worship one of the so-called Dark Trio, chaotic deities
who evince freedom, anarchy, and disorder.

- __Memnon.__
Memnon was the first manifestation of Chaos. He is Madeera’s twin, a red-maned,
leonine being whose ultimate ambition is to rend the cosmic laws of the
Covenant from his sister’s skin. 

- __Ramlaat.__
Ramlaat is the Pillager, the Barbaric, the Horde. Many orcs worship him and
live by the Blood Rite, a prophecy that says only the strongest will survive a
coming doom.

- __Shune the Vile.__
Shune whispers arcane secrets to sorcerers and witches who call to her in the
dark hours. She schemes to free the vast flow of magic by displacing Ord.

## The Lost

Two of The Nine are lost to the ages, their names expunged from history and
memory. Yet their whispered legend lives on in ancient texts and forgotten
places...

## Patrons

Mugdulblub and The Willowman are two of the many eldritch beings of immense
power who grant boons in exchange of their petitioners' service.

- __Mugdulblub.__
The Elder Ooze that leaks between the cracks in memory and the darkness between
the stars. Mugdulblub seeks the dissolution of all physical form.

- __The Willowman.__
A ghostly, elongated being who stalks misty forests and watches from the edge
of nightmares. The Willowman seeks fear.
