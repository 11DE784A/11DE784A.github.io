Seven of the nine bloodstones set in this magic sword's pommel are filled with
Reeve Winters's blood. You get a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with

__Bloodstones (2 Uses).__ When you fail a saving throw while holding Nine
Lives, you can choose to suceed instead. If you do so, you take 7 (2d6)
necrotic damage as one of the bloodstones set in the sword's pommel fills with
your blood.

__Wither (1/day).__ On a hit with an attack with this magic weapon, you an
choose to deal an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage to the target.

## Slime Form

As an Action, you and everything you are wearing and carrying can turn into a
puddle of slime for a number of minutes equal to your level. 

While in __Slime Form__, your movement speed is halved and you gain a climb
speed.  You cannot talk, attack, or cast spells. You have resistance to
Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; and Immunity to the Prone
condition. You can move through narrow openings.

On your turn, you can use your Action to come out of Slime Form. You also
come out of Slime Form if you are dropped to 0 Hit Points.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.


## Night Hunter's Knife

_Weapon (dagger), Rare, requires attunement_

Dried blood tinges the bone handle of this ragged butcher’s knife. You get a +2
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

__Night Hunter Curse.__ Every time you use this weapon to kill a creature,
make a DC 15 Wisdom save. If you fail three of these saves during the time you
are attuned to this weapon, you fall into a mental fog and lose your sense of
self, becoming the new Night Hunter in the nearest forest.
