# Magic Items (and homebrew abilities)

## Ring of Ramlaat

_Ring, Rare, requires attunement_

A bone-carved ring with a ram skull. Its horns twist forward and red lights
glow in its eye sockets (adapted from _[Shadowdark
RPG](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark)_ &copy; [The Arcane
Library, LLC](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/)).

When your hit point total drops to zero while wearing this ring, you can remain
conscious and keep fighting. You take a -1 penalty to your constitution score
for every round you spend fighting this way.  You must complete a long rest and
succeed a DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw to restore your constitution score.

## Pebble of Predictability

_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

This perfectly round pebble lets you tap into the magic of Madeera, the
manifestation of law. Trained eyes can glimpse laws from the Covenant engraved
on its surface.

When you make a D20 test while carrying the pebble, you can treat a roll of 9
or lower as a 10 on the die. You can use this property a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus. Number of uses resets at dawn.

## Nine Lives

_Weapon (long sword), Rare, requires attunement_

Seven of the nine bloodstones set in this magic sword's pommel are filled with
Reeve Winters's blood. You get a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
this magic weapon (adapted from _[Flee,
Mortals!](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/flee-mortals-the-mcdm-monster-book)_
&copy; [MCDM Productions, LLC](https://www.mcdmproductions.com/)).

__Bloodstones (2 Uses).__ When you fail a saving throw while holding Nine
Lives, you can choose to suceed instead. If you do so, you take 7 (2d6)
necrotic damage as one of the bloodstones set in the sword's pommel fills with
your blood.

__Wither (1/day).__ On a hit with an attack with this magic weapon, you an
choose to deal an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage to the target.

## Slime Form

As an Action, you and everything you are wearing and carrying can turn into a
puddle of slime for a number of minutes equal to your level. 

While in __Slime Form__, your movement speed is halved and you gain a climb
speed.  You cannot talk, attack, or cast spells. You have resistance to
Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; and Immunity to the Prone
condition. You can move through narrow openings.

On your turn, you can use your Action to come out of Slime Form. You also
come out of Slime Form if you are dropped to 0 Hit Points.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.


## Night Hunter's Knife

_Weapon (dagger), Rare, requires attunement_

Dried blood tinges the bone handle of this ragged butcher’s knife. You get a +2
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon (from _[The Night
Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eekHr9RKfYQ)_ &copy; [The Arcane
Library, LLC](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/)).

__Night Hunter Curse.__ Every time you use this weapon to kill a creature,
make a DC 15 Wisdom save. If you fail three of these saves during the time you
are attuned to this weapon, you fall into a mental fog and lose your sense of
self, becoming the new Night Hunter in the nearest forest.
