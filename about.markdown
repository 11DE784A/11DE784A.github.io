# About Me

My name is Ayush Singh (<span class="hindi">आयुष सिंह</span>), and I am a PhD student in
[Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://www.math.sissa.it/content/geometry-and-mathematical-physics-0)
at [Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati
(SISSA)](https://www.sissa.it/). I work under the supervision of Pavel Putrov
on aspects of Chern-Simons theory and certain quantum invariants of 3-manifolds.

Before joining SISSA, I was an integrated master's
student in physics at [NISER](https://www.niser.ac.in/), where in my [master's
thesis](https://11de784a.github.io/assets/files/thesis_ayush_singh.pdf), I
studied the one-loop structure of various quantum field theories, and modern
techniques for recursively computing tree-level scattering amplitudes in gauge
theories. For more academic details, see [my
CV](https://11de784a.github.io/assets/files/cv_ayush_singh.pdf).

I like abstract math, its applications to physics, and I write
[code](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/) in my free time.

## Fun Stuff

* I made a podcast! See [NiSERCast](https://nisercast.gitlab.io), and also [How
  to Make a NiSERCast]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-06-09-how-to-make-a-nisercast.markdown %}).
* From March 2019 to August 2021, I was the Benevolent Dictator of NISER
  Coding Club.
* I have also contributed to a number of [NISER Software Development Group](https://sdgniser.github.io) projects:
[Listings](https://github.com/sdgniser/listings),
[Lost and Found](https://github.com/sdgniser/lnf),
[Spaghetti](https://github.com/sdgniser/spaghetti),
[Timetable](https://github.com/sdgniser/timetable).
