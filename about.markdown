# About Me

My name is Ayush Singh (<span class="hindi">आयुष सिंह</span>), and I am a PhD student in
[Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://www.math.sissa.it/content/geometry-and-mathematical-physics-0)
at [Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati
(SISSA)](https://www.sissa.it/). I work under the supervision of Pavel Putrov
on aspects of Chern-Simons theory and certain quantum invariants of 3-manifolds.

I have master's and bachelor's degrees in physics from [National Institute of Science Education and
Research (NISER)](https://www.niser.ac.in/). At NISER, I did my [master's
thesis](/assets/files/thesis_ayush_singh.pdf) on scattering amplitudes and loop
calculations in gauge theory under the supervision of Chethan N. Gowdigere.
And I did my [bachelor's thesis](/assets/files/on_cyclic_quantum_heat_engines.pdf) on
cyclic quantum heat engines under the supervision of Colin Benjamin.

I like abstract math,
its applications to physics, and I write [code](https://github.com/{{
site.github_username }}/) in my free time.

## Fun Stuff

* I made a podcast! See [NiSERCast](https://nisercast.gitlab.io), and also [How
  to Make a NiSERCast]().
* From March 2019 to August 2021, I was the Benevolent Dictator of NISER
  Coding Club.
* I also contributed to a number of [NISER Software Development Group](https://sdgniser.github.io) projects:
[Listings](https://github.com/sdgniser/listings),
[Lost and Found](https://github.com/sdgniser/lnf),
[Spaghetti](https://github.com/sdgniser/spaghetti),
