In this post, I reflect on my experiences at NISER (both good and bad) by 
"reviewing" some courses that I think were interesting. There are no ☆ ratings,
sorry about that.

## M201: Real Analysis

- __Iteration__: Fall 2018
- __Course Instructor__: Dr. Sanjay Parui
- __My Grade__: CC

Like most people who end up doing a PhD in mathematics, this was my first big
boy maths course. And like most people in their first analysis course, I found
it extremely hard.
While, after significantly more than a _minor's_ worth of
math courses, I now appreciate the Dr. Parui's decision of starting with
_foundational_ topics --- like [Zorn's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn%27s_lemma), 
and a proof of the
[Schroder--Bernstein theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem) --- 
I could not appreciate it at the time. Four years later, I still have a primal
fear of the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice).

But I have some fun memories of this course as well. More than once, I remember
marvelling at how little the defining properties of $$\mathbb{R}$$ --- like
its [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)) structure and 
[completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-upper-bound_property) --- were used in certain proofs.
Specifically, when studying things like [continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function), 
[compactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space) and
[connectedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectedness), 
it is only the _topological structure_ that matters. 
Unfortunately, as fascinating as I found it, I was still not very good at it. I
remember many nights at the library, reading [Baby
Rudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis) at 
3 a.m. and trying to parse something like the [open cover definition of
compactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#Open_cover_definition).

Things finally started clicking into place for me in the second half of the
semester. I pulled an all nighter to work through the chapter on
[Riemann
integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Stieltjes_integral)
in Rudin, slept at 6 a.m., and went to write a quiz at ten.  This was the first
quiz in this course that I felt good about.
From here, it was relatively smooth sailing till the endterm, but I had done
too badly in the first half of the semester to salvage my grade. The fact that
I had an overloaded schedule this semester did not help.

## P454: Particle Physics

- __Iteration__: Spring 2021
- __Course Instructor__: Dr. Chethan N. Gowdigere
- __My Grade__: AB

This was probably the _fanciest_ course I took at NISER. I knew I was going to
love it when, in the introductory lecture, Dr. Gowdigere quoted
[Wigner's definition of a particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_classification) 
as _an irreducible representation
of the Poincaré group_. This definition sits right at the intersection of
abstract math and physics that I love so much. In four
words it tells us that we need relativistic 
([Poincaré group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group)) quantum mechanics
([irreducible representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_representation)) 
to do particle physics. It also tells us the the starting point for studying
relativistic quantum mechanics is a classification of irreducible
representations of the Poincaré group.

We spent a lot of time trying to understand this definition in what amounted to
a mini-course in group representations at the beginning of the course. We also
did some field theory, and in particular, learned how to use the [gauge
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_principle) to figure out the form of interactions in the lagrangian
and Feynman rules for vertices. We learned about the 
[Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism),
[electroweak symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction#Lagrangian), 
and how the Standard Model lagrangian (modulo
the [CKM matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabibbo%E2%80%93Kobayashi%E2%80%93Maskawa_matrix)) 
is constructed.  The course ended with an explicit derivation
of interactions in the gauge, Higgs and electroweak sectors of the Standard
Model. This choice of topics is what I meant when I said this course was fancy.
More technical things like the 
[subtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation) 
[points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_fixing) 
[of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faddeev%E2%80%93Popov_ghost) 
[quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(physics)) 
were left for a quantum field theory course. 

I must point out that typically, this is not how this course goes. The
details depend very heavily on the interests of the course instructor. With
someone else as the instructor, we could have spent a lot of time computing
decay rates and cross-sections, which are extremely important and things that
every particle physicist know cold. But... these calculations are also very
long and very dull and, in my opinion, better learned in your own time. What I
am saying is that I would not have enjoyed this course nearly as much as I did
if it was taught by a different instructor.
(In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to say that I ended up doing my
[master's thesis](/assets/files/thesis_ayush_singh.pdf) 
under Dr. Gowdigere's supervision in quantum field theory and gauge theory,
largely because of this course.)

Finally, I cannot end without saying that half of this course was conducted
online, in the middle of the second wave of the coronavirus. Personal
reasons, poor management of the pandemic by NISER and inherent difficulties of
online education notwithstanding, this semester ended up being very difficult
for me academically. With four advanced electives (particle physics, phase
transitions, general relativity, and Lie groups), I really struggled with the
load, and probably would have even if everything else was normal. It may be
recency bias, but this semester was probably the most academically demanding
period of time I have ever experienced.

## M558: Representations of Linear Lie Groups

- __Iteration__: Spring 2021
- __Course Instructor__: Prof. Varadharajan Muruganandam
- __My Grade__: AA

This was without doubt the hardest course I took at NISER. It was very hard to
keep up with the lectures, not least because I was a physics major and this was
an advanced elective offered to master's students specializing in analysis. I credited
this course because I thought it would be a nice conclusion to a reading project
I did on Lie groups and Lie algebras in the summer of 2019, but there were
pre-requisites in topology, measure theory, and functional analysis that I was
not prepared for.

Broadly, speaking this was a course in harmonic analysis over compact Lie
groups. Harmonic analysis is a field of mathematics that studies
generalizations of the Fourier series. For example, in the expression for
Fourier coefficients of a complex-valued periodic function on the real line,

$$
\hat f_k = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(t) \bar\chi_k(t) dt,
$$

the $$2\pi$$-periodic function $$f$$ can be seen as a function on [the group $$S^1$$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_group);
the mapping $$\chi_k : \mathbb{R} \to S^1$$ given by $$\chi_k(t) = e^{ikt}$$ can be
seen as a group homomorphism; and $$dt/2\pi$$ can be seen as an invariant
measure on the group $$S^1$$. The idea of harmonic analysis is to generalize
these notions by replacing the circle by a compact topological group $$G$$ that comes
with an invariant measure. [Haar's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_measure#Haar's_theorem) guarantees the existence of a
unique non-trivial invariant measure on locally compact topological groups, and
in particular on compact groups.
Once we have a way to integrate over
the group, we can replace the $$2\pi$$-periodic function by an element of
$$L^1(G)$$, and the group homomorphisms $$\chi_k$$ by [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_theory) of
representations of $$G$$. All of this theory culminates in the [Peter--Weyl
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter%E2%80%93Weyl_theorem), which gives a kind of classification of representations of compact
groups, and [Plancherel's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plancherel_theorem), which gives the analogue of Fourier series
for compact groups.

The material I learned in this course remains, to this day, the most abstract
and the most beautiful mathematics I have seen. However, once again, I have to say
that since more than half of this course was conducted online due to the second
wave of the coronavirus, it was not as fun as it would have otherwise been.
This was also Prof. Muruganandam's last course before his retirement from
NISER, and it was very difficult seeing him trapped behind a screen and
speaking into, what must have felt like, a void. As of right now, more than a
year after the course's conclusion, I feel comfortable thinking of it
as a positive experience largely because I am in a much better position academically
(and also because I got a pretty good grade at the end). 

It's hard to care about beautiful mathematics when it feels like the world
around you is crumbling.

As my time at NISER comes to an end, I feel like this is a nice place to pause
and reflect on some of my experiences and talk about some of the coolest things
I have learned in the last five years.
