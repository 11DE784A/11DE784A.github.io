I hate reading long PDFs that do not have an outline attached. So, I spent one
afternoon making an outline for Witten's _Analytic Continuation of Chern–Simons
Theory_, when I should have been reading it.

Here is the [outline](/assets/files/1001.2933/1001.2933.txt), [PDF with outline attached](/assets/files/1001.2933/1001.2933_outlined.pdf), and a [link to the
original (arXiv:1001.2933)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2933).
