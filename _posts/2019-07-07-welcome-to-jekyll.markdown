You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. 
Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Another code block

    print('Hello, world')

Math stuff. Here is some inline math $$ E = mc^2 $$. Followed by a math block

$$
\begin{align}
  (AB)_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}B_{jk}
\end{align}
$$

Sexy.
