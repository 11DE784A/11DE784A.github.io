# Notes

[__Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz-Weitzenböck
Formula__](/assets/files/notes/schrodinger_lichnerowicz_weitzenbock_formula.pdf)
These notes are an (unsuccessful) attempt to write down basic facts about spin connections,
Dirac operators, and curvature in notation that conforms to my aesthetic
sensibilities (no proofs, sorry!).

[__Group C\*-Algebras__](/assets/files/notes/group_cstar_algebras.pdf)
I made these slides for a talk I gave as a part of the course
_C\*-algebras That One Can See_ at SISSA. Includes a proof of
the fact that every unitary representation of a group induces a nondegenerate
unitary representation of the group C\*-algebra and vice versa.

[__Analysis on the Euclidean Motion
Group__](/assets/files/notes/analysis_on_the_euclidean_motion_group.pdf) A classification of
representations of $$M(2)$$, the Euclidean motion group in two dimensions. Also Fourier
transforms, Parseval identity, Plancherel theorem for square-integrable
functions on $$M(2)$$.

[__Hilbert Spaces, Tensor Products and Representations of $$\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb
C)$$__](/assets/files/notes/hilbert_spaces_tensor_products_and_representations_of_sl(2,C).pdf)
Includes a proof that every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis, a short
discussion of tensor product of Hilbert spaces, classification of unitary
representations of the Lie algebra $$\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb C)$$, addition of
angular momentum.
